## About

Hi! My name is Daniel Olofsson. I am a junior at Minmuteman Vocational High School in Massachusetts studying Engineering. In my free time, I like solving Rubik's cube (18.8s), playing video games (Minecraft), playing volleyball, snowboarding, and using my Bambu 3D printer for solving small problems around my house.

### Earbud key chain (Sept 2025)

When my earbud case was in my pocket, I had to get up to put away my earbuds. I created this model to be able to access my earbud case while sitting down.
