## About

Hi! My name is Daniel Olofsson. I am a junior at Minmuteman Vocational High School in Massachusetts studying Engineering. In my free time, I like solving Rubik's cube (18.8s), playing video games (Minecraft), playing volleyball, snowboarding, and using my Bambu 3D printer for solving small problems around my house.

## Projects

### Receipt & Pen Container (Nov 2025)

These two containers were designed to hold the pens and receipts at the restaurant I work at. The old containers were not tall enough.

### Tornado Lamp (Oct 2025)

The tornado lamp was a solo-project during my Junior year in Engineering.

### Phone case (Oct 2025)

I had two phone cases prior to designing my new one. My previous phones did not have a flat back nor hold my driver's license. I printed my phone case in black TPU to better resist falls and be easier to find in the snow.

### Earbud key chain (Sept 2025)

When my earbud case was in my pocket, I had to get up to put away my earbuds. I created this model to be able to access my earbud case while sitting down.

### Marble roller coaster (May 2025)

This was a two-person Engineering assisbnent. Groups had to come up with a way to make an infinite loop for marbles. Each project needed to have at least 2 3D-printed parts.

### Water spout holder (Dec 2024)

At my job, the water spout was getting jammed when between the two pieces of wood, and would keep flowing water after taking the pitcher away. The water spout was very inconvenient to pick up when it was disconnected.

### Minecraft redstone Fun (2018)

When I was about 10 years old, I was very interested in minecraft redstone. I followed many online tutorials and tried to design my own things as well.
